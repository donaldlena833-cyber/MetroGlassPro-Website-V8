            If you&apos;re looking at frameless shower doors for a NYC apartment, chances are you&apos;ll end up with a single swing door. It&apos;s the most common configuration we install — by a wide margin — and for good reason. One glass panel, two hinges, a handle. Clean, minimal, and it works in nearly every bathroom layout.
          </p>

          <h2>Why NYC apartments love the single swing door</h2>
          <p>
            Most NYC bathrooms are compact. A single swing door keeps things simple — there&apos;s no fixed panel eating into the opening width, no track system along the top or bottom, and no multi-panel engineering to complicate the install. You get one clean sheet of tempered glass that swings open and closed.
          </p>
          <p>
            For apartment bathrooms with standard shower openings between 24&quot; and 32&quot;, a single swing door is usually the right call. It maximizes the opening width (no frame or track taking up space), and the frameless look makes the bathroom feel bigger — critical when you&apos;re working with 40 square feet.
          </p>
          <p>
            It&apos;s also the fastest to install and the most affordable frameless option, which is why it&apos;s the entry point for most NYC homeowners upgrading from old framed doors.
          </p>

          <h2>Glass thickness: 3/8&quot; vs 1/2&quot; for single doors</h2>
          <p>
            For single swing doors, 3/8&quot; (10mm) tempered glass is the industry standard and what we recommend for the vast majority of NYC installations. Here&apos;s why:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Weight:</strong> A 3/8&quot; panel weighs roughly 5 lbs per square foot. A typical 30&quot;×72&quot; door comes in around 75 lbs — manageable for standard wall-mount hinges and safe for tile walls with proper anchoring.</li>
            <li><strong>Strength:</strong> 3/8&quot; tempered glass is extremely strong. It exceeds ANSI Z97.1 safety standards and handles daily use without any concern.</li>
            <li><strong>Cost:</strong> 3/8&quot; glass is more affordable than 1/2&quot;, and the hardware can be lighter-duty, which saves further.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            When do we recommend 1/2&quot; (12mm)? For oversized panels — anything wider than 32&quot; or taller than 78&quot; — where the extra rigidity prevents flex. Also for clients who simply prefer the heavier, more substantial feel. The weight difference is noticeable: a 1/2&quot; panel of the same size weighs about 100 lbs, which requires heavier hinges and more robust wall anchoring.
          </p>

          <h2>Inward vs outward swing: which direction?</h2>
          <p>
            This is one of the first questions we address during measurement, and the answer depends entirely on your bathroom layout.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Outward swing (into the bathroom)</strong> is the default in most NYC apartments. The door swings away from the showerhead and water, which means less water escapes when you open it. It also means you don&apos;t lose any usable space inside the shower.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Inward swing (into the shower)</strong> makes sense when the bathroom is so tight that an outward-swinging door would hit the toilet, vanity, or bathroom door. This is more common than you&apos;d think in NYC — especially in older co-ops where the toilet is 18&quot; from the shower opening. Inward swing solves the clearance problem, though you lose a few inches of standing room inside the shower.
          </p>
          <p>
            Many of the hinges we use — including the CRL Geneva — support 180° swing, meaning the door can swing both directions. We default to outward but can configure for either direction during fabrication.
          </p>
          <p>
            The key measurement: you need at least the full width of the door panel as clear swing space. A 28&quot; door needs 28&quot; of clearance in the direction it swings. We check this during the measurement visit and recommend the best direction based on your specific layout.
          </p>

          <h2>What a single swing door costs in NYC</h2>
          <p>
            A single swing frameless door typically falls in the $800–$1,500 range installed, depending on glass thickness, hardware finish, and door size. This makes it the most affordable frameless configuration — and often the best value when upgrading from a framed door.
