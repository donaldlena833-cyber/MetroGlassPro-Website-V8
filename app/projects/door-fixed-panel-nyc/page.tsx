            Once your shower opening exceeds about 32–36 inches, a single swing door starts to become impractical — the panel gets too heavy, the swing arc takes up too much bathroom floor, and the glass flexes more than you want. That&apos;s where the door + fixed panel configuration comes in.
          </p>

          <h2>When you need a fixed panel</h2>
          <p>
            The general rule: if your shower opening is wider than 36&quot;, you split it into two pieces — a swinging door and a stationary (fixed) panel. The fixed panel is permanently mounted to the wall or a support bar, and the door hinges off either the wall or the fixed panel itself.
          </p>
          <p>
            This is extremely common in NYC bathrooms that have had the bathtub removed and replaced with a walk-in shower. The old tub opening is typically 60&quot; wide — way too wide for a single door. A door + fixed panel fills that space cleanly: usually a 24–28&quot; door plus a 30–34&quot; fixed panel.
          </p>
          <p>
            The fixed panel doesn&apos;t move, so it acts as a structural wall of glass. Combined with the swinging door, you get a full enclosure with the minimal, frameless look — no bulky tracks or frames.
          </p>

          <h2>NYC tub-to-shower conversions</h2>
          <p>
            This is one of the most common renovation projects in NYC apartments. The old bathtub comes out, a new shower base goes in, and the 60&quot; opening needs glass. Door + fixed panel is almost always the right answer here. We do these regularly across all five boroughs.
          </p>
          <p>
            A few things specific to NYC tub-to-shower conversions:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>The opening is rarely perfectly level or plumb.</strong> Older NYC buildings settle, tile work varies, and walls are almost never straight. We measure every edge with precision tools and fabricate the glass to match the actual dimensions — not the &quot;should be&quot; dimensions.</li>
            <li><strong>The fixed panel needs a support bar.</strong> For wider configurations, the fixed panel is stabilized with a support bar running from the top of the glass to the opposite wall. This prevents lateral movement and keeps everything rigid.</li>
            <li><strong>COI and building coordination</strong> is the same as any other install — we handle it all.</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>Hardware matching: door + panel</h2>
          <p>
            One of the details that separates a premium install from a budget one is hardware coordination. In a door + fixed panel setup, you have multiple pieces of hardware that all need to match:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Hinges</strong> on the swinging door (wall-mount or glass-to-glass)</li>
            <li><strong>U-channel</strong> or wall clamp holding the fixed panel to the wall</li>
            <li><strong>Glass-to-glass clamp</strong> if the door hinges off the fixed panel</li>
            <li><strong>Handle/towel bar</strong> on the swinging door</li>
            <li><strong>Support bar</strong> connecting the top of the fixed panel to the wall</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            All of these need to be in the same finish — chrome, brushed nickel, matte black, satin brass, or whatever you choose. We spec the complete hardware package as part of the quote so nothing is mismatched. The satin brass hardware in the photo above is a popular choice right now for NYC renovations.
          </p>

          <h2>Typical cost range</h2>
          <p>
            Door + fixed panel configurations typically run $1,200–$2,200 installed in NYC, depending on the total glass area, thickness, and hardware finish. It&apos;s more than a single swing door because there&apos;s more glass and more hardware — but for wider openings, it&apos;s the only frameless option that works well.
