            In plenty of NYC bathrooms — especially those with a shower-over-tub combo — there&apos;s simply no room for a swinging door. The toilet is right there. The vanity is right there. The bathroom door is right there. A sliding bypass system solves this completely: two glass panels on a track, one slides behind the other. Zero swing clearance needed.
          </p>

          <h2>Best for tub-shower combos with no swing clearance</h2>
          <p>
            The classic NYC scenario: a 60&quot; bathtub with a showerhead, and the bathroom is so tight that a hinged door would slam into the toilet or vanity. This is the single most common situation where we recommend sliding bypass.
          </p>
          <p>
            Two frameless glass panels sit on a track — typically a top-hung barn-door style system with exposed rollers and a guide rail. One panel is fixed, the other slides. The entry point shifts left or right depending on which panel you move.
          </p>
          <p>
            The frameless version is a massive visual upgrade over the old aluminum-framed sliders that most NYC apartments still have. Those framed sliders collect grime in the tracks, develop mildew in the frame channels, and eventually get stuck or wobbly. A modern frameless bypass system eliminates most of those problems.
          </p>

          <h2>Frameless bypass vs framed sliders: cost comparison</h2>
          <p>
            A standard framed sliding shower door from a big-box store runs $200–$500 for a basic model. But the quality difference is obvious — thin glass, aluminum frames that corrode, bottom rollers that fail.
          </p>
          <p>
            A custom frameless bypass system typically runs $1,400–$2,500 installed. The price difference comes from:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Thicker glass:</strong> Frameless uses 3/8&quot; tempered glass vs the 1/4&quot; or 5/32&quot; in framed doors. Heavier, stronger, and optically clearer.</li>
            <li><strong>Better hardware:</strong> Stainless steel or brass roller systems vs cheap plastic wheels. The barn-door track hardware alone is a different class of product.</li>
            <li><strong>Custom fit:</strong> Measured and fabricated to your exact tub dimensions. No shimming, no guessing, no gaps.</li>
            <li><strong>No frame:</strong> The frame itself is what collects mold and corrosion. Eliminating it means a cleaner look and less maintenance over time.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            For NYC homeowners planning to stay in their apartment for more than a few years — or prepping for a co-op/condo sale — the frameless upgrade pays for itself in both daily experience and resale value.
          </p>

          <h2>Maintenance and cleaning tips</h2>
          <p>
            Frameless bypass doors are lower-maintenance than framed sliders, but they&apos;re not zero-maintenance. Here&apos;s what we tell every client after install:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Track and rollers:</strong> Wipe the track with a damp cloth monthly. If rollers start to feel sticky, a drop of silicone lubricant on each roller restores smooth operation. Do not use WD-40 — it attracts dust and grime.</li>
            <li><strong>Glass:</strong> Squeegee after each shower to prevent hard water spots. NYC water is relatively soft compared to other cities, but mineral deposits still build up over time. A weekly spray of white vinegar + water (50/50) keeps glass clear.</li>
            <li><strong>Bottom guide:</strong> The small guide at the bottom of the tub that keeps the sliding panel aligned — clean this out occasionally. Soap scum and hair can accumulate there.</li>
            <li><strong>Silicone seals:</strong> Check the seals where glass meets the tub edge once a year. If they&apos;re peeling or discolored, a re-seal takes 15 minutes and costs almost nothing in materials.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Most of our bypass installations run for years without any service calls. The barn-door roller systems we use are commercial-grade and handle daily sliding without wear issues.
